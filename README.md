# NerdBot-ng!
##### Yet another discord bot that does nothing!

## Setting the darn thing up!
1.1. Create a file called "config.json" where "main.js" is located!
    Syntax for "config.json" should look like:
        ```
            {
                "token": "BOT_TOKEN",
                "prefix": "Choose a prefix like: nerd! or n! check the wiki for more info",
            }
        ```

1.2. if you have windows just install node.js and run the start-dbg.bat file!

###### I am not responisble for 1. Thermonuclear war 2. You getting fired because the bot kept pinging you on mobile 3. Your PC or VPS blowing up!
