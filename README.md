# NerdBot-ng!
##### Yet another discord bot that does nothing!

## Setting the darn thing up!
1. Create a file called "config.json" where "main.js" is located!
        For more info on config.json check out the wiki!

2. if you have windows just install node.js and run the start-dbg.bat file!

3. this is untested on linux, macos, or ANY OTHER OS (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Haiku, DOS, iOS, Android, etc)

###### I am not responisble for 1. Thermonuclear war 2. You getting fired because the bot kept pinging you on mobile 3. Your PC or VPS blowing up!
