# NerdBot-ng!
##### Yet another discord bot that does nothing!

## Setting the darn thing up!
1. If you have node.js installed, cd into the cloned/downloaded directory and do  "npm install" which should install the bot's depencies (node-fetch, nodemon, and discord.js) (or you can just install them using "npm install node-fetch nodemon discord.js" in the command line while in the project directory and open up start-dbg.bat or using "nodemon main.js"
2. Create a file called "config.json" where "main.js" is located!
        For more info on config.json check out the sample config file!

2. if you have windows just install node.js and run the start-dbg.bat file!

3. this is untested on linux, macos, or ANY OTHER OS (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Haiku, DOS, iOS, Android, etc)

###### I am not responisble for 1. Thermonuclear war 2. You getting fired because the bot kept pinging you on mobile 3. Your PC or VPS blowing up!
